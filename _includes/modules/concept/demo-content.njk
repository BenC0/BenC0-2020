		<p>What if personalisation was used for more than marketing?</p>
		<p>What if themes weren't just for day/night switching?</p>
		<p>This website is an experiment.</p>
		<p>The intention of this website is to show how you can give the user the power to control aspects of the UI to better suit their needs.</p>
		<p>In the top, right hand corner you'll find a cog icon.</p>
		<p>Tapping this will open the customisation options.</p>
